# kaptureScreen
[C#] Screen-Capture EXE, in the background. Some Win32 API. Used for debugging Selenium-machines, by storing the captured-images in a shareable-folder, it allowed remote-"debugging" to help figuring out what the machine is showing at the moment, w/o the need to actually remote-desktop connecting to it. Can be used for malicious purposes, beware!
